## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

The Geek Protocol team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### Where to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us through one of the following methods:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/GEEKProtocol0110/geek-protocol-docs/security/advisories/new)
2. **Direct Contact**: Message the team on [Telegram](https://t.me/GEEKonKAScommunity) (request private conversation with admins)
3. **Email**: Contact us through our official channels (link in repository)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include PoC code or screenshots
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress (at least every 7 days)
- **Timeline**: We aim to patch critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Credit**: With your permission, we will credit you in our security advisories

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To protect our users, we ask that you:

- ✅ **DO**: Report the vulnerability privately before public disclosure
- ✅ **DO**: Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before going public
- ✅ **DO**: Act in good faith and avoid privacy violations or data destruction

- ❌ **DON'T**: Access or modify other users' data

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

- Regular dependency updates
- Code review process for all changes
- HTML validation and link checking on PRs
- Secure hosting on trusted platforms

### Smart Contract Security (Future)

When smart contracts are deployed:

- Multiple independent security audits
- Bug bounty program
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Emergency pause mechanisms
